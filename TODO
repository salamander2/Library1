This is just listing what needs to be done in the next few days, not the whole project.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* failed authentication: why not use logout?

* Patrons: list, search, DONE
* Patrons: add, edit, delete
  Add/Edit: JS check format. PHP validate (rather than sanitize?)

  DELETE patron: check for fines, books out.

* Is there any way of using CRUD for this?

* Fix up UI colours
