This is just listing what needs to be done in the next few days, not the whole project.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

>>>> DONE <<<<
* Patrons: list, search, add, delete. 
* Library Card: add, render lost/expired
* php read in a header:
        $homepage = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/');
        echo $homepage;


<<<< TODO >>>>>
* Patrons: delete
* Patrons: barcode search
* patronView.php (light lavender header)

* failed authentication: why not use logout?
* Look at all FIXME and TODO

* Add/Edit Patron: JS check format. PHP validate (rather than sanitize?)

* BIB records: display, how many copies, how many are available.

  DELETE patron: check for fines, books out.

* Is there any way of using CRUD for this?

** Users: add an admin user. 
                Then have a usermaint page
                also add/edit site announcements

-----------------------------------------
Things I am NOT doing:

% library branches

------------------------------------------
php filter_var()


Sanitize then validate. Validate works a lot better than sanitizing.

FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL
FILTER_VALIDATE_INT

FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL
Remove all characters except letters, digits and !#$%&'*+-=?^_`{|}~@.[].
