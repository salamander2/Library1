This is just listing what needs to be done in the next few days, not the whole project.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* failed authentication: why not use logout?

* Patrons: list, search, add, delete. DONE
* Patrons: delete

>>>>>  Add/Edit: JS check format. PHP validate (rather than sanitize?)

  DELETE patron: check for fines, books out.

* Is there any way of using CRUD for this?

** Library Card: add, render lost/expired

** Users: add an admin user. 
		Then have a usermaint page
		also add/edit site announcements

* php read in a header:
	$homepage = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/');
	echo $homepage;
