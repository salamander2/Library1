This is just listing what needs to be done in the next few days, not the whole project.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

********************* IN PROCESS *******************


************************* DONE *************************

* Add/Edit Patron: JS check format. PHP validate (rather than sanitize?)

* PAC.php
-- browse books
-- search by fields, 
-- check what happens if PAC tries to go to a different page (e.g. userMaint..., bibEdit, ...)

* Patrons: list, search, add. 
* Patrons: barcode search
* patronView.php (light lavender header)
* Library Card: add, render lost/expired
* php read in a header:
        $homepage = file_get_contents('http://www.example.com/');
        echo $homepage;
* BIB search done
* BIB search: ISBN needs to be done
* BIB records: display, how many copies, how many are available.

* Harmonize all error messages. Move to new notify.js system
** Users: add an admin user. 
                Then have a usermaint page
* fix header so that "administer" button only shows up for ADMIN and also not on the actual ADMIN pages.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< TO DO >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>


** Admin User: add/edit site announcements

* checkin / checkout

* Patron: PAC, login and display,

* DELETE patron: check for fines, books out.  What happen with LibraryCards?

	PatronEdit: add confirm to delete button
        change the <a href> to a simple button
        write the deletion code and return the success / error message
        DELETE FROM patron WHERE id = 33;

        To see if the patron exists, you can do 
                SELECT id FROM patron WHERE id = 33;   If you get an empty set, then there is no patron 33.

                the deletion code must move the patron to patron.his
                just copy the record, then delete it. Do we need a field explaining why it was deleted? Nah, maybe later. 
                Also initials of staff who deleted?


* night process: overdues, ...
* staff place holds, holds filled upon CKI
* Patron: place holds

* failed authentication: why not use logout?
* Is there any way of using CRUD for this?

------------------------------------------
php filter_var()

Sanitize then validate. Validate works a lot better than sanitizing.

FILTER_VALIDATE_INT
FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL

FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL
Remove all characters except letters, digits and !#$%&'*+-=?^_`{|}~@.[].
