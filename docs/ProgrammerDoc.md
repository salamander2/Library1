## Programmer Documentation

* Most of the documentation is in the code.
* The top of each php file describes its function and where it is called from.
* php is used for most data manipulation

--------------------
I'm not using `if(isset($_POST['submit'])) {...}` a whole lot. Instead I'm calling other PHP pages to do things like update the database.
This is because each page is getting longer as I'm adding more JS to do input validations and I'm making the UI look better.
